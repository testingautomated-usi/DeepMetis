# Installation Guide

Installation instructions are offered for both the tools and the experimental evaluation.
For each tool, we provide a default configuration.
* [Instructions for MNIST](/DeepMetis-MNIST/README.md): the user should expect logging information until the end of the run.
* [Instructions for UnityEyes](/DeepMetis-UE/README.md): this tool requires the installation of UnityEyes and Sikuli on a pc equipped with Windows OS. If everything is correctly installed, the user should expect to see the UnityEyes GUI generating eye images. The user must not interact with the pc unless the run is finished. The underlying algorithm is the same as the previous point.
* [Instructions for experimental evaluation](/experiments/README.md): we provided our results as input, the expected output is reported in csv files and is coherent with the data reported in the manuscript.
